# MMM-GoogleKeep

This is a module for the [MagicMirror²](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror/).

This modules displays one list from Google Keep with checkboxes. 
The current state of the project is proof of concept. If you need more functionality, create a pull requests or open an issue.

As there is no official API for Google Keep, the python module [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi) is used.

## Dependencies

- [python-shell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-shell)


- [gkeepapi](https://github.com/kiwiz/gkeepapi)


## Install

To install the module, use your terminal to:

1. Navigate to your MagicMirror's `modules` folder. If you are using the default installation directory, use the command: 
```
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
```

2. Clone the module to your computer by executing the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/taxilof/MMM-GoogleKeep.git
```

3. Install the `python-shell` library by executing the following command:
```
npm install
```

4. Install gkeepapi 
```
pip3 install -U gkeepapi
```

## Troubleshooting
If you are hitting `gkeepapi.exception.LoginException: ('BadAuthentication', None)`, follow these steps:
- Double check your username and password
- Try downgrading requests: `pip3 install requests==2.23.0`
- Try downloading the latest python3 version. This is more involved, see [instructions here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=291310#p1761359).

## Using the module

### MagicMirror² Configuration

To use this module, add the following configuration block to the modules array in the `config/config.js` file and insert your details:
```js
var config = {
    modules: [
        {
            module: 'MMM-GoogleKeep',
            position: "bottom_top",
            header: "Google Keep",
            config: {
                username: 'test@example.com',
                password: 'pass',
                noteId: 'id',
                updateInterval: 60,
                maxLines: 30,
                //width: 400,
                //unchecked_only: true,
            }
        }
    ]
}
```


### Configuration options

| Option           | Description
|----------------- |-----------
| `username`       | *Required* Your Google Keep username
| `password`       | *Required if no masterToken* Your Google Keep password
| `masterToken`       | *Required if no password* Your Google Keep master token, as an alternative auth flow. See [gkeepapi docs](https://gkeepapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#obtaining-a-master-token) and [HomeAssistant Google Home docs](https://github.com/leikoilja/ha-google-home?tab=readme-ov-file#master-token).
| `noteId`         | *Required* The ID of the list you want to display. Open the list in browser and copy the ID from adress bar (example: '1aGdg26b2Aza6ga3aKa6gafa41e1Eag8LFVkE_klE4ap0i13HGoBmNeLp3a4')
| `updateInterval`       | *Required* How many seconds to wait before fetching an update
| `maxLines`       | *Required* Maximum number of lines to display
| `width`          | *Optional* Maximum width for the list to take up, in pixels. Default allows full width of Magic Mirror screen.
| `unchecked_only` | *Optional* Set to true to only display unchecked items. Default false

## Issues

Sometimes the gkeepapi reports a NeedsBrowser Error:
```
Error: gkeepapi.exception.LoginException: ('NeedsBrowser', 'To access your account, you must sign in on the web. Touch Next to start browser sign-in.')
```
This can be resolved by a login to keep.google.com in a browser.
    


## Todo

- [ ] add error handling
- [ ] more options, e.g. CSS settings
- [ ] use gkeepapi.sync() to keep script running instead of starting a new instance each time
